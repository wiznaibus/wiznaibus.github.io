        <p>yo wtf i'm so fucking mad i can't believe you've done this. i make $2 an hour selling used loofas and
          cigarettes in the bed bath & beyond back alley and i'm scraping by as it is. my kids shoes are falling
          apart and this is how you fucking treat me. i've been saving up for this album for 2 years and i just
          want something to listen to when i have a glass of wine at the end of the night. is that too much to ask
          for? just send me a refund already so i can buy my kids some chicken nuggets.</p>
