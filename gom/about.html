<h1 class="h2 pt-3 pb-2 mb-3 border-bottom">About</h1>
<p>I am creating this site to facilitate the management of group orders. After speaking to some GOMs and seeing how
  many different sites and tools they use to manage their GOs, I wanted to create a centralized location where every
  administrative aspect of a group order could be managed.</p>

<p>This site lists group orders for informational purposes only. Any selling of products, including payment and
  shipping, are handled by each group order's respective manager(s). If you have any questions or problems with an
  order, please contact your GOM for help.</p>
